<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> watched part of Shereef's <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">fireside chat</a>. Here are my thoughts, which are mostly informed by his description of the two mindsets of cohorts (consumer/restaurant patron vs. creator/kitchen worker).</p>

<p>The DBC Experience: As with most things in life, you get out of experiences what you put into them. Completely cliche but hey, it’s true. Life, and evidently DBC, are messy. If you sit around waiting for things to be handed you, it isn’t going to happen (even if you paid $12k for the experience). Which you know initially sounds kind of ridiculous, to be honest. If I paid so much money SHOULDN’T my education be handed to me? Of course what I have paid for is an experience, not a good or service, and an experience means I need to be actively involved. But the money aspect definitely can lead down the entitlment/consumer rabbit hole, which I suppose is where mindfulness comes in: monitor your feelings, if you are starting to feel entitled/annoyed/like coasting through, catch yourself and switch gears. Also important to remember that it’s not just about you, it’s about your whole team/cohort/pair.</p>

<p>Impression of DBC: I’m still not sure what my impression of DBC is. It is overall positive. I’m only 4 days into Phase 0 but my cohort seems great solely passed on the Google Plus community. I’m excited to work with the people in my cohort. Everything so far has been really well organized and I feel like I’m being challenged by the week 1 curriculum. I’m mostly just enjoying myself. And as Shereef said if you don’t like something about DBC, get in there and make it happen, it is your education.</p>

<p>How I see myself engaging with the DBC culture: I picked up and left a well-established career to go to DBC. My former coworkers think I’m insane but that’s ok, it is sort of insane (and some of them are just jealous!). Leaving your job and upending your life is messy, and it sounds like DBC is going to be messy, and after a career of everything being pretty routine and rather oppressivly buttoned-up, I welcome the mess, the creativity and the freedom. I also like the idea of not going it alone, and working with a team of people who are also doing something radically new with their lives. I tend to be introverted, which doesn’t mean I don’t like people, it just means I like some downtime to myself. I might not be getting a ton of that when DBC onsite starts.</p>

<p>Have my expectations of DBC changed?: No. I expected to work hard, and I expected to ultimately be in control of my own education. I really am paying for the DBC structure (because while I know I could teach myself all of this, and have been trying for months, DBC seems to have a good system going with how to learn a ton of stuff in a short period of time) and learning with like-minded (and not so like-minded, although at least we all have made the decision to attend DBC, so we have that in common) people.</p>

<p>How I am feeling: Mostly excited. Also competitive (mainly with myself). A little nervous. One of the things Shereef talked about in the video is the two fears of students: some people have imposter syndrome, some people have I’m-too-good-for-this syndrome, and some people have both simultaneously. I think I might have a little bit of both. I’ve been self-studying since March, so it’s a little weird to put up a blog post without any CSS and I’m having to remind myself that the requirement for week 1 is the content of the blog post, not how it looks. I’ve also been using Git and Github since March, but I had a serious case of “I didn’t know how much I didn’t know!” when I went through the week 1 curriculum on git–lots of stuff about branches and merging that I have never done before.</p>
