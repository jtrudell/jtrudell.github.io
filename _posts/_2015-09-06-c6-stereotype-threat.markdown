title:  "Stereotype Threat"

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>tereotype threat is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you are a member of a group subject to a negative stereotype and you are aware of that stereotype, your performance during certain tasks may suffer as you worry about acting out that stereotype rather than completing the task. I'm a woman in tech. The stereotype is that women are not good at math. I am acutely aware of this stereotype, I honestly don't think I'm very good at math, and I worry that I will fail or look stupid and not only embarass myself but prove the stereotype to be true. With all that on my mind it is no wonder I could get nervous and preocuppied and perform poorly in a technical interview. I know I am smart, I know my skills are solid and I'm learning more every day, but still I worry that everyone is watching and waiting for me to slip up and prove that the stereotype about women and math is true. I don't know what to do about this. I suppose being aware of stereotype threat, just like being aware of impostor syndrome, is helpful. Being mindful of negative thoughts and looking at whether they originate from stereotype threat could help combat them. Solidifying my skills, and not comparing myself to others, also helps.</p>
