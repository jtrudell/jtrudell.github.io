<h3>Thinking Style</h3>

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore you start <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>, you have to take the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">Gregorc Personal Thinking Styles Quiz</a>. Turns out I am a "Abstract Sequential" thinker and learner. Which, according to the introduction to the quiz, means I <q>love the world of theory and abstract thought.</q> This is true. I love to learn, period, and what I love to learn isn't straight facts through memorization but theories, methods, and why things are they way they are. Some of the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm" target="_blank">traits of abstract sequential learners</a> are as follows:</p>

####  This learner likes:
- his/her point to be heard
- analyzing situations before making a decision or acting
- applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems

####  They learn best when:
- they have access to experts or references
- placed in stimulating environments
- able to work alone

####  What's hard for them?
- Being forced to work with those of differing views
- Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly
- Repeating the same tasks over and over
- Lots of specific rules and regulations
- "sentimental" thinking
- Expressing their emotions
- Being diplomatic when convincing others
- Not monopolizing a conversation

<h3>How My Thinking Style Plays Out in the Real World</h3>

In the real world (or semi-real world) of Dev Bootcamp, my thinking style has worked really well. Applying logic to solving problems is well suited to the world of programming, and I have certainly been placed in a stimulating environment through the Phase 0 course work. I have also, except for a few weekly peer pairing sessions, been able to work alone. I think that once Phase 0 is over and I am onsite, it will be a challenge for me to spend 90% of my time pair programming. I like being around other people, but I definitely like to work on my own. Although it hasn't happened yet in Phase 0, I also imagine that the workload when we are all onsite will give me less time than I would like to spend on many subjects, and I will probably find that frustrating (ok, it will completely give me panic attacks). My instinct and preference is to fully understand things, no matter how long it takes, and having to time box and gain a shallow knowledge of how some things work will be difficult and, honestly, it will just suck. But that's one of the tradeoffs of DBC vs a CS degree: short vs. long, (relatively) cheap vs. $100k plus in student loans, broad and (perhaps, don't know for sure yet) shallow knowledge vs. narrow (and not necessarily job friendly) and deep knowledge.

  <h3>Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</h3>

Fortunately, I also know that I have a growth mindset. According to <a href="http://www.mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/index.html" target="_blank">Carol Dweck</a>,<blockquote cite="http://www.mindsetonline.com/whatisit/about/index.html">"In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard workâ€”brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment."</blockquote>

I know that I can learn to be comfortable solving problems with others. Although not going to lie, never going to love group work, the pair programming has been more fun that I thought it would be. I know I can learn how to deal with short timeframes when processing a ton of information. In my career as a lawyer, I did learn how to work with less time than I wanted (and a LOT more paper than I wanted), and I am sure I can learn how to do the same with my code. If I had a fixed mindset, I would throw up my hands, assuming that all of my traits and talents were what they were, and not work towards learning new ways to do things. And in the past, I've certainly fallen into that trap--I'm looking at you, 19 yearold self who dropped out of the CS program in college because I wasn't "good at" advanced calculus . Dev Bootcamp is a challenge, and I am confident I can learn how to work through it. Abstract sequential may be my thinking style, but that doesn't mean that the parts of it that don't work for me cannot be changed.
