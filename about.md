	<p class="intro">I used to be a finance attorney, and yes, I will laugh at your lawyer jokes. I like to build things: web apps, mobile apps, IKEA furniture.</p>

  <p>I'm a backend software engineer at iLoan in Chicago, working primarily on our Rails API. I'm currently sort of obsessed with Go. I'm a proud Dev Bootcamp graduate (Purple Martins!). In a prior life, I was a finance attorney in Chicago, and before that in NYC. Want to know more?
