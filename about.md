	<p class="intro">I used to be a finance attorney, and yes, I will laugh at your lawyer jokes. I like to build things: web apps, mobile apps, IKEA furniture.</p>

  <p>A recent graduate of <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>, I'm currently looking for a full-time position as a junior developer in Chicago. In a prior life, I was a finance attorney in Chicago, and before that in NYC. Want to know more?
