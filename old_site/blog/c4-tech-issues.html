  <h1>Tech has an age problem</h1>
  <h2>(even if I still get carded buying beer)</h2>
  <h4>August 20, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>I'm a woman, gay, and a mother, but what scares the crap out of me isn't being discriminated against because of one or more of those things. What scares me is being discriminated against because of my age. I am in my 30s, and from everything I have read I'm kind of over the hill already in the tech world. Granted, these <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117088/silicons-valleys-brutal-ageism" target="_blank">stories</a> are dealing with the surreal world of Silicon Valley, not my more down-to-earth midwestern home of Chicago, but still, it is a concern. I like t-shirts, beer and ping pong as much as the next guy (or gal), but I'm not 22, or even 28. Will I show up at interviews and be dismissed because I am 10 years older than the person interviewing me? Or worse, will I not even get interviews because my resume (I ask again: do people still use resumes?) shows that I graduated from high school in the late 90s?</p>

    <p>Of course, age discrimination in hiring is <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/06/19/tech-job-ads-discrimination/" target="_blank">illegal</a>, but also very, very hard to prove. The solution to all this is probably just time. The tech industry post the dot-com bubble of 2000 is pretty young, and it will age together with its 25 yearold CEOs. An ideal workplace is diverse on all levels: race, gender, age, sexual orientation, people with kids (and people who never want to have kids), educational background, ability, and experience. That sometimes older people will be less experienced than younger people should be a plus, not a detriment. I look forward to learning from any future young coworkers. I also hope I can show them some unique perspectives, both from my experience as a former-lawyer closing deals and from being around when the coolest webistes were on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970222174751/http://www1.geocities.com/" target="_blank">Geocities</a> (animated gifs! Shiver.).</p>
