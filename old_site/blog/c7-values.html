  <h1>Challenge and Integrity</h1>
  <h2>Using Values to Combat Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h4>September 11, 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>I like a good challenge. It is why I went to law school. It is why I moved to NYC to work after law school knowing very few people. It is one of the reasons I taught myself how to code. When I see something that looks hard to do, I want to try it. Sometimes I give up, and that's ok as long as I'm giving up for the right reasons. When I was in middle school, I dreamed of being an NBA player. I was 4'10 and a girl. It was ok to give up on the impossible. Unlike playing in the NBA, learning to code isn't impossible. Sure, coding can be really, really tough, but the rush I get when I finally solve a tough coding problem makes the challenge fun.</p>

    <h3>Integrity</h3>
    <p>I value integrity, in myself and in others. Being a lawyer was challenging, and it certainly wouldn't have been impossible for me to continue to succeed as a practicing lawyer, but, for me, being a lawyer lacked integrity. I was pretty good at being a finance attorney and I provided my clients with excellent representation, but my heart wasn't in it. I am not of the "you have to love what you do!" school of thought. I think that's pretty unrealistic, to always love, or even like, your job. But I do think that if you are privileged and lucky enough (because of education, economics, age, ability, where you live, etc.) to be able to do what you want, you should do something that meshes with your interests and does not leave you waking up in the morning dreading the day ahead. Continuing to be a lawyer wasn't fair to myself, and being unhappy a lot of the time wasn't fair to my family or friends. Being a lawyer simply was not the way to live the rest of my life, to live a life with integrity.</p>

    <h3>Stereotype Threat and Self-Worth</h3>
    <p><blockquote>"A general means for protecting the self from perceived threats and the consequences of failure is to allow people to affirm their self-worth."</blockquote> The above quote is from <a href = "http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself" target="_blank">an article</a> DBC suggested we read. Stereotype threat is, in short, performing poorly at a task because you are part of a group which is stereotyped as bad at that task. Think of women and math/tech/code. I'm not incredibly concerned about failing at DBC or coding. I know I'm up to the task, and I've worked hard and gotten through rough spots, and will continue to work hard and get through future rough spots. I am concerned, however, about having a difficult time finding a job after DBC because I of the stereotype that women are not good at tech/math, and I'm afraid that my fear will result in me performing poorly during technical interviews. Reminding myself that I like a good challenge (combating stereotypes AND solving problems during interviews == double the challenge!) and that I value integrity (I need to be true to myself, and do the best I can, not worry about how other people might be perceiving me) will hopefully help me assuage my anxiety and feel good about myself. Self-worth translated into a boost of self-confidence to stamp down stereotype threat.</p>
