		<li><a href="https://github.com/Salt7900/breadcrumbs" target="_blank">breadCrumbs</a> <span class="description"> an iOS app written in Swift with a backend server written in Ruby on Rails. breadCrumbs allows a user to leave themselves or a friend a note and a photo at a specific location. When the recipient visits this location in the real world, they receive a notification that they have a breadCrumb to view. breadCrumbs was my final project for Dev Bootcamp, created over a period of 8 days in November 2015 with two teammates.</span></li>
